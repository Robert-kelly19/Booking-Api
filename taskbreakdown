🧠 Day 1: Project Setup + Auth Basics
Goal: Set up the environment and build out user authentication.

✅ Tasks:
 Initialize Node.js project (npm init)

 Install core dependencies: express, mongoose, dotenv, jsonwebtoken, bcryptjs, etc.

 Set up folder structure (routes, controllers, models, middleware)

 Configure environment variables (.env)

 Connect to MongoDB (or your chosen DB)

 Create User model (with role: client or provider)

 Implement:

 User registration endpoint

 User login endpoint (return JWT)

 Create auth middleware to protect private routes

 Test auth flow with Postman or Insomnia

🔁 Optional (but helpful): Set up your CLI for project scaffolding or seeding users/providers.

🛠️ Day 2: Provider & Slot Management
Goal: Allow providers to manage availability, and clients to view open slots.

✅ Tasks:
 Create Service Provider model (if not merged with User)

 Create Time Slot model (date, time, duration, provider, isBooked)

 Create endpoints:

 Provider creates a time slot

 Provider views their time slots

 (Optional) Provider updates/deletes time slots

 Endpoint: Clients view available slots for a specific provider (by date/date range)

 Seed some test providers and slots into the DB

 Test endpoints

🔁 CLI Tool: Add command to seed or reset providers/time slots

📅 Day 3: Appointment Flow + Real-Time
Goal: Enable booking, viewing, canceling appointments + real-time notifications.

✅ Tasks:
 Create Appointment model (client, provider, slot, status)

 Endpoints:

 Book appointment (validate slot is available → mark as booked)

 View "My Appointments" (Client)

 View "My Bookings" (Service Provider)

 Cancel appointment (update status, free slot)

 Integrate Socket.io:

 Notify provider when a new appointment is booked

 (Stretch) Notify client + provider when an appointment is canceled

 Test all flows with Postman & WebSocket client

🧪 Day 4: Testing, Swagger Docs, Polish & Publish
Goal: Final polish — test it, document it, and get ready to ship.

✅ Tasks:
 Set up Jest (or Node test runner)

 Write tests for:

 Registration/Login

 Booking flow

 Slot availability

 Set up Swagger:

 Document all routes (auth, slots, appointments)

 Final cleanup (linting, error handling, config)

 Optional: Dockerize your backend for easier deployment

 Publish your CLI tool to npm:

 Set bin in package.json

 Add shebang + CLI logic

 npm login + npm publish

 Write/update README.md
